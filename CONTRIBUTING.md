## ðŸ›  Developer Setup

To contribute cleanly to this project, we recommend setting up a local
environment with basic tooling.

### ðŸ”¹ Required Developer Tools

Please ensure you have the following installed locally:

- [`shfmt`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) â€” for shell script formatting

Install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install shfmt
```

We use `shfmt` to automatically format `src/.zshrc` for consistency.

> **Note:** Syntax checking (`zsh -n`) and formatting validation (`shfmt -d`)
> are handled automatically by GitHub Actions CI.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Pre-Commit Hook Setup

To enable automatic formatting of `src/.zshrc` before every commit, manually copy the pre-commit hook:

```bash
cp git-hooks/pre-commit .git/hooks/
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

This ensures consistent formatting standards.

## ðŸ§© Recommended VSCode Extensions

To ensure a smooth development experience, we recommend installing the
suggested extensions when prompted by VSCode or Cursor:

- **Shell Format** (`foxundermoon.shell-format`) â€” Formats `.zshrc` cleanly
  using `shfmt`
- **EditorConfig** (`editorconfig.editorconfig`) â€” Ensures consistent
  formatting rules across different editors
- **Markdownlint** (`davidanson.vscode-markdownlint`) â€” Helps maintain clean
  and consistent Markdown style

These extensions are optional but highly recommended.
