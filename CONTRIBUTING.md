## ðŸ›  Developer Setup

To contribute cleanly to this project, we recommend setting up a local
environment with basic tooling.

### ðŸ”¹ Required Developer Tools

Please ensure you have the following installed locally:

- [`shfmt`](https://github.com/mvdan/sh) â€” for shell script formatting

Install it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install shfmt
```

We use `shfmt` to automatically format `src/.zshrc` for consistency.

> **Note:** Linting and syntax checking (`zsh -n` and `shellcheck`) are handled
> automatically by GitHub Actions CI.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Optional: Pre-Commit Hook for Auto-Formatting

To automatically format `src/.zshrc` before every commit, run the provided setup
script:

```bash
scripts/setup.sh
```

This will install the pre-commit hook automatically.
It ensures that all committed changes stay consistent with our formatting
standards without manual intervention.
