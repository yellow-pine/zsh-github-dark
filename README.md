  - GitHub Dark Terminal Profile color-matching
  - Dynamic prompt (git branch, dirty marker, timing, exit code coloring)

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

1. Clone this repository:

2. Install the recommended Homebrew packages:

   ```bash
   brew install coreutils lsd bc pyenv nvm poetry
   ```

3. Copy the `.zshrc` to your home directory:

   ```bash
   cp .zshrc ~/.zshrc
   ```

4. Import `github-dark.terminal` into Terminal.app:
   - Open Terminal âž” Settings âž” Profiles âž” Import âž” select `github-dark.terminal`
   - Set it as the default profile.

5. Set `zsh` as your default shell:

   ```bash
   chsh -s /bin/zsh
   ```

6. Set `zsh` as root's shell to fix `sudo su -`:

   ```bash
   sudo chsh -s /bin/zsh root
   ```

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.nvm
   ```
